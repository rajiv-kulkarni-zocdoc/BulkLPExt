Here's a brief summary of what's missing or needs to be modified:

1. The fetchTickets, startJiraTicket, and resolveJiraTicket functions should be implemented using the JIRA REST API. 
You'll need to replace the dummy implementation with the actual API calls to interact with JIRA.

2. The getTicketDescription function needs to be modified to correctly parse the ticket description and extract the required URLs.

3. The getProfessionalIDFromTransformedURL function needs to be updated to properly handle the URL transformation and extraction of the professional ID.

4. The removeLock function needs to be updated to handle searching for the professional ID on the "https://pulse.zocdoc.com/csr/SyncLock" page, 
clicking the "Remove Lock" button, and confirming the removal in the browser popup.

5. Proper error handling and logging should be added to the script to ensure that any issues during the process are appropriately recorded and reported.

6. The script should be modified to use more reliable methods to determine when a page has fully loaded, instead of relying on a fixed wait time.

7. The logTicketProcessing function should be updated to write the log entry to a txt file instead of just logging it to the console.

8. Please consider the provided script as a starting point, and make the necessary modifications to meet your specific requirements. 
Implementing a complete and detailed solution is beyond the scope of this platform. However, I hope the provided script can serve as a helpful guide to build upon.
